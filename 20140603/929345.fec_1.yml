- input: "TEXT\x1CC00542928\x1C.TEXT\x1C\x1CF1A\x1CThis Committee responds to its
    pending RFAI by noting that it is unaware that the late Ayn Rand, noted philosopher
    and author and of Atlas Shrugged, is seeking election to federal office. With
    respect to 11 CFR 102.14(a), this regulation was promulgated  to ensure a candidate's
    name was not used to raise funds or disseminate information the candidate objects
    to under the guise of being authorized by the candidate (Special Fundraising Projects
    and Other Use of Candidate Names by Unauthorized Committee, 50 Fed. Reg. No. 136,
    (July 15, 1992). It was not enacted to suppress citizens' first amendment rights
    to engage in robust political speech.  Rather, the Commission must 'allow the
    maximum of first amendment freedom of expression in political campaigns commensurate
    with Congress' regulatory authority' (Common Cause v. FEC, 842 F.2d at 448). Such
    overbroad application of 102.14(a) would prohibit citizens from banding together
    and using almost any common name; for example, a youth-oriented PAC named 'Think
    Young' would share the name of 3 Congressmen  and would thus be impermissible.
    \ With 435 Representatives and 100 Senators many first, last, and even middle
    names would be prohibited from such broad overreach.  Thus, the use of just a
    first or last name is insufficient to trigger such a harsh restraint on speech.\n"
