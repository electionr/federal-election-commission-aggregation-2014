    of their time on Federal Election Activity during this time period.   Because
    a large number of the purchases for each Bingo event are for less than $50.00,
    we follow the procedure on Page 61 of the Manual and report these as unitemized
    individual contributions on line 11 of our FEC reports.  State law requires that
    some expenditures be made by cash and some by check.  Cash is used to pay most
    prizes.  If a prize exceeds $50.00, we have the person fill out a voucher with
    name, address, date and amount.  Rent, office supplies, bingo supplies and advertising
    must be paid by check.  Reportable expenditures are shown on line 21 of our FEC
    reports.  If someone exceeds the $200 in a calendar year we believe we have included
    the requested information on our report(s).  Due to a default setting on our campaign
    finance software, several transactions were attributed to a prior year's cycle
